# MY-DAQ-System
This project implements a data acquisition (DAQ) system that reads sensor data from multiple environmental sensors and stores the readings for further analysis. It uses an ATmega328P microcontroller, interfaced with a USB-to-TTL converter (CH340), to gather data from three key sensors
